# YOLOv4 Object Detection with OpenCV

This repository contains an implementation of object detection using YOLOv4 and OpenCV in Python.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```pip install opencv-python numpy```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git```

2. Download the pre-trained YOLOv4 weights and configuration files from the [official website](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#pre-trained-models) and place them in the root directory of your cloned repository.

3. Download the COCO class names file from the [official website](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names) and place it in the root directory of your cloned repository.

4. Place the image you want to perform object detection on in the root directory of your cloned repository.

5. Run the script:

```python script.py```
